# Amazon front end clone

This project is a basic Amazon-inspired homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate key elements of the Amazon website, such as the navigation bar, search bar, hero section, cards, and footer.

The project consists of the following files:
- index.html: The main HTML file.
- style.css: The CSS file for styling.
- All the images used in the css (styling) are stored as separate files.

I did this project to improve my HTML and CSS skills.

- Hope you like it.
- Give your contribution to make it better.
